# BrainSimII
Neural Simulator for AGI research and development

I appreciate your interest in this project and hope your experience will be positive. There are many ways to participate at all levels of AI ability. As a first-timer, you can download a release, try things out, report any bugs, and make a few suggestions. At the other end of the spectrum, you can dive into the code, create modules and training sets. and more.

**Brain Simulator II** is a free, open-source software project aimed at creating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Many important features set it apart from other Artificial Intelligence software:
1.	*The AGI Strategy.* With the primary assumption that no one knows specifically how to create AGI, the Brain Simulator implements an experimental platform with a general AGI model which is easy to revise. Several spiking neuron models based on biological neurons combine with software “Modules” to create any desired functionality for rapid experimentation. 
2.	*The User Interface.* The graphical display of neurons and Modules lets users explore and modify the internal workings of the Network in real time. 
3.	*The Powerful Spiking Neuron Engine.* Tested with a billion neurons, the Brain Simulator can process up to 2.5 billion synapses per second on a desktop computer. Networks can also be distributed across a LAN with estimates of neocortex equivalence with only 160 servers.
4.	*Software Modules and Applications.* To speed AGI development, over 50 Modules perform a variety of AI tasks. Combined with the Neuron Engine, applications already demonstrate vision, mobility, internal modelling, and planning.
	
The **Brain Simulator** implements an artificial entity named “Sallie” who lives in a simulated world and can integrate input from multiple senses. She can recognize objects with binocular vision and associate them with words she hears, plan a sequence of actions, and manipulate objects to achieve a goal. As she advances to understanding her world, interfaces already exist for cameras, microphones, and robotic control to bring AGI to life.


Again, thanks for your interest!
